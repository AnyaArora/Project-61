            <p>     I love to read. When I read I learn new words. I also love diving into fantasy world. When I leave I know it is still there waiting for me. I read books about monsters and battles. I don't like non-fiction books about real people. I like books with action. Anyway, my teacher says I'm a good writier.(I don't belive him) He also says its because of all the books I read. Maybe it is. I like reading books, and when I read I take the author of the books writing stlyes and make my own. I really love reading. Maybe you should go get a book to read too. (I got part of the paraghraph from books.)

            <h3>    Hello! I'm back. I hope you didn't miss me to much! (got part of that from a book) Anyway, one of my favorite book seiers it "The Keeper of the Lost Cites" seires by Shannon Messenger. (I'm really sorry if I spelled your name wrong) Another one of my favorites is "Percy Jackson" by Rick Riordan (Once again sorry bout the names. ) So, those are my top two but I love all the books I read. That's because if I don't like a book I stop reading it. Okay, see you later.

        <h1> My favorite Charaters
            </h1>
        <p>This is pretty hard. I've read a lot of books with a lot of charters. My absolute favorite charator if Keefe from the "Keeper of the Lost Cites" sieres. Then comes Shopie and Fitz from the same seires. After that is Anabeth from "Percy Jackson" and Leo, also from "Percy Jackson". Those are my top five favorite characters. </p></section>
